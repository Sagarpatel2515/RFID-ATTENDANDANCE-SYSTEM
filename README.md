# RFID-ATTENDANDANCE-SYSTEM
This project demonstrates how to build an RFID-based attendance system, a technology commonly used to log attendance by scanning RFID cards or tags. Each tag has a unique ID, which the system uses to identify individuals, making it a quick and contactless way to track attendance.

 # Project Overview
The RFID Attendance System uses an RFID reader to scan unique RFID tags assigned to individuals. When a tag is scanned, the system reads its ID, records attendance in the database, and displays relevant information on an LCD screen. This project combines RFID technology with microcontroller programming to automate attendance-taking in schools, offices, and events.

# Key Features
1.RFID Scanning: Uses an RFID reader to read unique IDs from RFID cards or tags.
Attendance Logging: Records attendance data in real-time, storing it in a database or file.
2.Display Module: Shows user information or attendance status on an LCD screen.
3.Microcontroller-Based: The system is built around a microcontroller (like Arduino or ESP32) to manage RFID inputs and display outputs.

# How to Use
Clone this repository and upload the code to your microcontroller (e.g., Arduino).
Connect the RFID reader and LCD display as per the provided wiring diagram.
Power on the system, and scan RFID tags to log attendance.
Check the database or file to review attendance records.

# Requirements
RFID reader and tags
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
LCD display (optional)
Arduino IDE (for programming the microcontroller)

# Applications
This project is ideal for automating attendance in various environments such as schools, offices, or events, helping to streamline the attendance process, reduce errors, and maintain organized records.
